<p class="auto-style4"><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">What better way to propose to the woman of your dreams 
is on Valentines Day, Christmas Day, Eid Day, Holly or Dewali Day. Corny but 
very romantic. Yes I realize a lot of you guys propose on ‘Valentines Day‘ 
because it is a national holiday and a romance filled day. But to make the 
proposal extra special, propose on a causal day. Pick a day that has special 
meaning to you both, such as a birthday, anniversary of your friendship or the 
day when you went for your first date and etc. A proposal isn’t something to 
take lightly. For a guy to remember special days such as the anniversary of 
friendship or first date and to propose on that particular day is a special 
proposal to a woman. A marriage proposal is a commitment between two people who 
are deeply, passionately in love.</span><br class="auto-style1" />

everyday, making a dedication will work charms with her. Call your local FM 
radio station, one you know she will be tuning into. What would you say on the

<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">If you can’t express your feeling or you are afraid of 
rejection then you can use banner for proposing a girl. You can get a banner 
prepared with the word ‘I Love You’ and have it displayed outside her house or 
in the workplace. It is advised that you do not use her real name on the banner, 
but use the endearment that you generally use to call her. You can also make a 
flying banner and can give surprise to your loved one by flying it over her head 
and making it the most excited and memorable moment of your life. Try this way 
only when you are sure that she is not going to reject your proposal.</span></p>
