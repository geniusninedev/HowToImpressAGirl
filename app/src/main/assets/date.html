<p class="auto-style2"><strong>5 things To Do While Dating on Christmas 2016</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">All over the world on 25th of December Christmas is 
celebrated. Christmas is a festival of joy, love, and brotherhood. It has 
different chaos than another day because Christmas holiday is much better than 
official holidays.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">People are ready to send Christmas greeting to their 
friends and family members. They also decorate their home with Christmas tree 
and wonderful lights. Then why should we set back to celebrate this day with our 
loved ones?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Let’s celebrate this Christmas eve with your 
girlfriends and make your holiday remarkable.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Here I am going to tell you about 5 things to do while 
dating a girl on Christmas 2016.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<strong><br class="auto-style4" />
</strong><span class="auto-style4"><strong>1. Invite her for a Dinner:</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">If you are dating a girl from a long time it is easy 
to invite her at home but be careful if you are new in a relationship. Try to 
avoid a gathering at home. Book a table in a good coffee shop or restaurant for 
this special day. Fix your time to meet and pick up from her home and don’t 
forget to wear wonderful clothes that she like the most.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">After picking up from her home while you are on way in 
a car please try to play her favorite songs and sing together to enjoy the 
moment. But don’t be over keep everything simple.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>2. Surprise her with Gifts:</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">If the time is of Christmas then sure these moments 
are meant to be a time of love and giving. We know that girls love gifts and 
especially the surprise gifts. Don’t spend more money on the expensive gift to 
show off. The magical key to the gift is to go super-sweet. Give her a beautiful 
card by writing some wonderful thoughts about her that you want to share. Don’t 
forget to hint at the gift about next gift.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Purchase a jar and write some love notes that you want 
to expressed. Notes with pickup lines and much more which make her smile. Try to 
give something related to her interests. If she loves minions then try to give 
minions teddy or keychains of minion. You can also give t-shirts minions printed 
on it. Do whatever she love and win her heart with gifts.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>3. Talk Talk and more Talks:</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Communication is way much more important in a 
relationship. It makes your relationship stronger by talking to each other and 
telling each other about each other’s life. Don’t forget to pay special 
attention while she is telling something of herself to you. Mark my words “She 
is keeping eye on your each and every gesture”. Girls attract more when you have 
some special attention on her small gesture also. The cute talk on a special day 
you have is something that matters a lot to both you.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>4. Visit Movie or Concert:</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Hopefully after a great dinner head for movie or 
concert happening nearby you. Actually, whenever the month of December start 
there are lots of movie and concert activities start. You have an endless option 
to enjoy together. Spend some good time together by dancing in any concert or 
enjoying movie sitting exactly besides your girlfriend.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Trust me some memories are unforgettable the Christmas 
eve and concert or movie make your evening more beautiful.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>5. Go to Fireplace:</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">December is full of winter. If you are running out of 
cold, get the fireplace nearby you and some good memories. Sitting next to her 
talk about your past how you meet and how long you want to go with her. That 
make sense to her about your trust towards her.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Visiting a fireplace may not be the sexiest thing you 
have ever done, but you will never know until you try. You can always go for a 
drink or bite before or after.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">After a wonderful evening of Christmas, you spend with 
other don’t forget to drop at her home. While leaving a car to ask for a hug 
that makes your memories more awesome and if things are smooth, you can always 
dare them to kiss yours at the end of the date. It’s pretty much a guaranteed 
good time.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style4"><strong>What to Do on a Second 
Date?</strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style1">If you managed to secure a 
second date, it means that the girl you went out with got really interested in 
you. Also, it can be your second chance to make a good impression and show your 
best self.<br />
<br />
First dates are associated with nervousness, uncertainty, and pressure – not the 
best emotions and feelings for having a great time. In addition to this, first 
dates tend to last no more than several hours especially if you arrange a 
real-life rendezvous with a stranger online and don’t want to waste your time in 
case she turns out to be not your type.<br />
<br />
So, you go out, communicate trying to get to know each other, and if there is a 
connection between you two, you ask her and she agrees to have a second date.<br />
<br />
Now that you’re not strangers anymore, you’ll feel more comfortable on your 
second date and this will let you be yourself. Also, you’ll get an opportunity 
to ask her the questions you wanted to ask during your first encounter and make 
sure that the first impressions weren’t deceiving.</span></p>
