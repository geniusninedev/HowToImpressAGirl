<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Words That Impress 
Girls</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Talking face to face is one thing and talking 
virtually is another. When you are face to face you can impress her with your 
sense of style, your personality and tone. Chatting, talking over the phone or 
writing an email to her is a different prospect altogether. Here if you are 
looking to impress the girl, you will have to do it solely using words.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">The most important tip when you want to impress girls 
with words is to convey a sense of dominance while being romantic. Don’t use 
words which convey a sense of fear, uncertainty or insecurity on your part.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>Tips to Remember With Words</strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style1">There are no hard and fast 
rules but the below pointers are known to work in conveying a sense of 
confidence:</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Use fewer words to convey your meaning. Research shows 
more impact is drawn through less words.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Avoid the use of words like could, can, may while 
using ‘we’ or ‘I’ as the subject. ‘Can I’ or ‘may I’, looks far less dominant 
that ‘I want’ or ‘I will’.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Be specific. Beating about the bush never works.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Don’t apologize explicitly. It looks bad in words if 
you are not face to face.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Avoid asking questions. It’s better to state rather 
than ask. Instead of asking “Can we date?” just state “Let’s date”.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Compliment with a sense of dominance, it looks 
attractive. Instead of saying “Your smile looks really pretty” you can say “I 
like your smile”</span></p>

<span class="auto-style4"><strong>Real Life Practical Examples</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Here are a few examples of the right use of words and 
the wrong use of words.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Wrong</strong>: Would it be possible to meet 
up for a date?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Right</strong>: Let’s date.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Wrong</strong>: I am really sorry if I hurt 
you.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Right</strong>: I didn’t want to hurt you.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Wrong</strong>: I think I am in love with you.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Right</strong>: The fact is I love you.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Wrong</strong>: Do you like me?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Right</strong>: I know you like me.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Wrong</strong>: You look very pretty with open 
hair.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Right</strong>: Open hair suits you.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Wrong</strong>: Your smile is very pretty.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Right</strong>: Gotta say, I dig that smile.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Always weigh the words against the thumb rule – does 
it sound dominant or submissive. Choose words which convey a sense of dominance. 
Girls find dominance more attractive than submissiveness.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">All along, don’t forget to be romantic – it’s one 
thing to be dominant and another to become unromantic. A balance between the two 
works best with girls.</span></p>
