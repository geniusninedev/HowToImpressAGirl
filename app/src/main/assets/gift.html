<p class="auto-style2"><strong>Gift Ideas</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style4"><strong>1. Chocolates: </strong></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><img class="auto-style1" src="chocolates.jpg" /></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">In any form, in any shape, in 
any taste. This conventional, age old, yet so unique and so new gift is 
considered V-Day certified gift by lovers all across the world. Chocolates are 
divine, decadent and are closely associated with love and romance. It arouses 
sensuousness and is one of the main causes of the adrenalin rush. Hence the 
moment you gift a bunch of chocolates to your sweetie on the special day, 
his/her mood will be set and you will be having a cozy and amorous time 
together.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style3"><strong>2. Flowers:</strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5">&nbsp;<img class="auto-style1" src="flowers.jpg" /></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">If by the term, a bouquet with 
red/pink roses is coming to your mind, then try to think out of the box. Apart 
from that fresh natural beauty, you can think of paper roses or plastic ones, as 
an epitome of everlasting love. Sounds quirky? Well, romantic as well. If your 
partner feels so, tell him/her those golden words: "I will love you till the 
roses die". Hence he/she will understand the depth of your emotions and will 
accept it with a smile. Don't forget to spray some perfume on it for an aromatic 
effect.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>3. Perfume:</strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><img class="auto-style1" src="perfumes.jpg" /></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;That can a wonderful 
option for your stylish and fashion conscious partner, don't forget to know 
her/his choice of fragrance before you hit the store. Tell him/her that the 
liquid might finish off, but the aroma will last long, just like your love. If 
she deeply loves you, ask her next year and confirm-she will be keeping the 
bottle, as a symbol of your feelings. Will not this be a return gift for you- 
What say!</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style3"><strong>4. Gift Box:</strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><img class="auto-style1" src="giftbox.jpg" /></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">Off course full of gifts-mind 
you! You can show how much you love your honey by making this handmade gift 
especially for him/her. Show your creative side and decorate the wooden/metal 
box purchased from outside with colorful sand papers, or crepe papers. Bring 
colorful paints and draw hearts and kisses to give a romantic look to the entire 
box. Fill it with chocolates, candies, cup cakes, candles and lots and lots of 
love in form of notes and poems inside it.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style3"><strong>5. Spa gift vouchers: </strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><img class="auto-style1" src="spa.jpg" /></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">Very trendy, as well as 
romantic. If possible buy two such vouchers together so that you can spend some 
quality time with each other. Pamper yourselves through the masseur and get 
rejuvenated with scented oils and lotions. Relax your mind with your partner, as 
you two get lost in conversations for those lovely hours.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style3"><strong>6. A String of Love Notes :</strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><img class="auto-style1" src="note.jpg" /></p>
<p class="auto-style6">&nbsp;This may take some time to set up, especially 
coordinating how they are delivered, but this romance-as-scavenger-hunt is the 
kind of sweet touch everybody enjoys. Depending on how involved you want to get, 
you can involve your loved one's friends and family in the process, allowing 
them to get in on the fun. You might start with a short message of fond 
appreciation, and then work through two or three more loving thoughts before 
ending with a reservation for your favorite dinner spot.</p>
