<span class="auto-style4"><strong>Tips to Help You Compose Your List</strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;<span class="auto-style1">Pick out specifics about your 
sweetheart. The more unique, the better.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Go into detail about why – it’s better to have three 
reasons you love him or her with a solid explanation than fifty without one at 
all.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">This is a love letter by another name, so take care in 
composing it. Rushing is a major mistake.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">On the other hand, do not get so wrapped up in 
choosing the perfect words that it’s never completed. Make a first draft and 
edit it, then pass it along.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Don’t ever lie. If you are just going to fake it, 
you’re better off not making a list.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
