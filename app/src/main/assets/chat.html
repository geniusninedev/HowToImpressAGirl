<p class="auto-style3"><strong>How to Impress a Girl on Chat</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1"><strong>First chats </strong>
are like first dates, where guys have no more than a few minutes to impress the 
girl. If you want to create the good first impression, let this guide show you 
the way.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style2"><strong>1. Be Confident: </strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">You probably have heard this 
one before, but it actually works! When you meet a girl in reality, you may get 
intimidated by her physical presence. Chatting gives men the power to get over 
this. You are at an advantage of being yourself without constantly worrying 
about</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">being judged for your looks or actions. Confidence is 
a game-changer and one of the biggest attractive qualities in a man.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style2"><strong>2. Be Interested: </strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">Women hate men tooting their 
own horn excessively. However, they feel worse if you assume a disinterested and 
silent stance throughout the conversation. Men are expected to show that they 
are interested in knowing about the girl as well. So, be inquisitive and ask 
questions. What does she like? Why does she like it? This will keep the girl 
hooked to the conversation. However, take care not to sound nosy. Giving someone 
their required space, even if it is online, is essential.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style2"><strong>3. Be Caring: </strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">Considering that you have been 
speaking to this girl for some time, showing signs that you care about her life 
is a very positive technique to use. If she had a rough day at work, be sure to 
put her at ease during the conversation. Did she have a headache the previous 
day? Ask her how she is feeling today. Showing concern will make her feel 
important. Listening to what she has to say will give you a place in her good 
books instantly.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style2"><strong>4. Be Inquisitive to See Her:</strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;After having built a 
rapport with a girl, and having realised that she likes speaking to you, it is 
time to take things to the next level. You can express a desire to see her. 
Webcams enable people to see each other while talking, in a few simple clicks. 
However, you need to know the right time to pop this question. Asking to view 
her through a webcam too early in the association might make you come across as 
someone who pays a great deal of attention to physical beauty. To a woman that 
is the worst thing a man can do. However, asking her for the webcam, after 
knowing her for some time, will make her feel comfortable.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style2"><strong>5. Be Genuinely Charming: </strong></span></p>
<p class="auto-style6">A man’s charming manner can be the greatest tool at his 
disposal, even when it comes to displaying it over the Internet. Once you have 
seen her, be sure to compliment her beauty. Be original. When it comes to 
compliments, women expect men not to be cheesy about it. Women love people they 
can feel safe with. Humour her. Make her laugh. Compliment her in a way that 
makes her blush and laugh at the same time. Not only will you come across as 
someone with a quirky sense of humour, but your gesture will be endearing to her 
too.</p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style2"><strong>6. Your First Hi:</strong></span><span class="auto-style1"><br />
<br />
Your first Hi should be unique, don't just message 'Hi', instead you can send 
any of the messages given below – <br />
<br />
"Can I disturb the busiest person of this world, just to say a Hi…"<br />
"Hello gorgeous, looking Beautiful in DP"<br />
"Hi, Can I say something about you..."<br />
<br />
It's a proven method for a getting an instant reply from a girl, just ask her 
something which she can't ignore and she'll have to reply you.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6">&nbsp;<span class="auto-style4"><strong>7. Be Honest</strong></span><br />
<br />
Last but not least, be honest. Never lie about your appearance, what you have 
come through or where you live. Girls are not into trivial things, such as money 
or appearance. Rather, they are very much moved by the honesty and genuineness 
that appears to get down the chat window through your words.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">&nbsp;<span class="auto-style4"><strong>8. Sense of Humor</strong></span><br />
<br />
Everyone loves a good laugh and most girls are attracted to guys with a great 
sense of humor. If you’re thinking on how to impress girls, always keep in mind 
that a great sense of humor is the basics of any relationship. Girls would 
groove on the fact that you have the ability of being cheerful and being able to 
laugh at yourself. Drink in the art of throwing in humor even during the hardest 
situations; this will change the way how girls look at you.</p>
