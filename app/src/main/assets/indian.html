Indian Girl</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img alt="alt" class="auto-style1" src="indian.jpg" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Indian girls are a unique breed and when it comes to 
impressing them, you need to invest an extra thought in your approach. The trick 
is to become the centre of her attention without actually letting her know it.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">It may take some time to impress an Indian girl, but 
with some patience, it is certainly possible. Read on to gain an insight into 
the art of wooing Indian girls.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>1. Be Confident</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">You can apply this tip for impressing almost any girl. 
Girls are naturally more attracted to men who are confident. Being confident 
does not mean being boastful. It simply means that you are comfortable with 
yourself and sure of your abilities. Having a confident attitude will also 
convey to the girl that she can depend on you. Believe it or not, but girls do 
look for these qualities in men.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>2. Impress Her Friends</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">This tends to have an indirect but amplified effect on 
the girl. By impressing her friends you can trigger a chain reaction which will 
eventually cause your dream girl to be impressed with you. You do not have to 
invest an effort to impress each one of her friends, but just her closest 
friends. Girls form their opinion of men by talking and discussing with their 
friends. If you are able to impress a girl’s friends, then you are half way 
through impressing her.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>3. Set Yourself Apart</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">You can’t expect to impress a girl until you set 
yourself apart from her other friends. You don’t need to be flashy, but rather, 
be distinctively caring for the girl. Make your woman feel that you genuinely 
care for her and can take pains to be there for her. This whole process is 
gradual and it may take some time before the girl actually notices that she is 
important to you.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>4. Be Chivalrous</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">One of the age old ways of impressing women, being 
chivalrous can very well cast a good impression on a girl. Though this is one of 
the basic things while dealing with women, it is certainly very important. 
Indian women have a high regard for men who respect them. Simple and trivial 
things like opening the door for her, pulling out chairs, and getting the bill 
can make a special place for you in the heart of your girl.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<strong><br class="auto-style4" />
</strong><span class="auto-style4"><strong>5. Cultivate a Talent</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Girls definitely have a special place for men who have 
a creative talent. A talent can easily help you to stand out from everybody, in 
her eyes. However, you need to ensure that you are actually good with your 
talent or it will probably count for naught. Playing the guitar or any other 
musical instrument is among the conventional talents of men that appeal to 
women. You can also try your hand at poetry or sketching to come off as a little 
eccentric.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>6. Make an Impression on Her Family</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">This tip holds good especially in India. Impressing 
the family of a girl will automatically make way for impressing the girl. If you 
have found the ‘one’, then this pointer can come in really handy for you. You 
can show off your good values and abilities to impress the family of the girl.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>7. Show off your Intellectual Side</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">You can certainly make a lasting impression on a girl 
if you are intellectual. Indian girls have a predilection for men who have a 
rich intellectual side, especially from the perspective of viability of a long 
term relationship. However, do observe precaution that while showing off your 
intellectual side; you do not come off as nerdy or mundane.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>8. Don’t Come off as Desperate</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">One of the worst things you can do while trying to 
impress a girl is coming off as a desperate people-pleaser. Always remember that 
you need to be subtle in your approach or all of your efforts will go in 
absolute vain. It is important to show your good attributes, but do not try too 
hard to make them apparent.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>9. Work on Your Appearance</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Looking good is apparently a prerequisite for 
impressing a girl. If you are not too sure about your fashion sense, then you 
can always consult a friend who has a good taste in clothes. You also need to 
take into account that it is not just your clothes that make up your appearance. 
You are also required to groom yourself so that you are counted among suave and 
cultured men.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>10. Take an Interest in Her</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Women like men who can lend a ear to them. A good 
listener is one of the qualities women look for in their potential partners. You 
can also hone yourself better to her liking if you have an insight into her 
likes and dislikes. By taking a genuine interest in her, you can also convey 
that you care for her and respect her views, opinions and interests.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>11. Compliment Her</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">A girl will always appreciate some genuine compliments 
towards her. But you do need to steer clear of the obvious applauses that she 
probably gets from everybody. Notice the little qualities she has and appreciate 
them so that she knows that she is in your radar. However, the age old 
compliments about beauty and looks also work on most girls if you make sure they 
are genuine.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Indian women are not that hard to please; it’s just 
that they take a little longer to please. All you need to be is consistent, yet 
a little subtle in your efforts to please the girl. However, do ensure that you 
are investing your efforts for the right girl.</span></p>
